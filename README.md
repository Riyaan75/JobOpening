# JobOpening 
In this application i have created application in which terraFormer can add jobs and archieve them and simple user can only see the jobs and can apply to them.
I have given isTerraFormer input in signup as well as in login so user can easily rectify what he want to do.
I have created its complete backend and tested successfully on postman but i am not able to connect to its frontend till now.But will try my best to do that as well.
